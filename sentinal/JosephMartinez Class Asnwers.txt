A. (a_n-1)*9. This is because we have a_n-1 choices for a valid string and we have 9 choices of numbers to add to that string

B.10^n-(a_n-1)*1=10^n-(a_n-1). This is because we have 10^n total possible ways of creating a string of n length, and a_n-1 of those are valid strings, 
so if we subtract the total number of valid strings from the total number of possible strings, we get the total possible invalid strings and we multiply
this by the number of possible things we can add this, but since we are only adding 0, there is only one possibility.

C.a_n=a_n-1*9 or a_n=10^n-a_n-1

Prop 23.1: All solutions to the recurrence relation a_n=s(a_n-1)+t where s/=1 
have the form a_n=(c_1)*(s^n)+c_2 where c_1 and c_2 are specific numbers.

Prop 23.3: The solution to the recurrence relation a_n=a_n-1+t is a_n=a_0+nt
